In addition to Require.js,  <a href="https://github.com/requirejs/text">Text.js</a> plays a significant role by loading the html templates and preparing them for the underscore templating process.   \r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t<a href="http://backbonetutorials.com/organizing-backbone-using-modules/" target="_blank">read full article</a>\r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\tTake advantage of Require.js compiler!
